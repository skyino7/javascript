## Variable Declaration in JavaScript

### var
` var statement is used to declare variables in JavaScript that are function-scoped.`

### let
`let keyword is also used for variable declaration. But the only difference is the variable declared with the “let” keyword is block-scoped and local variable.`

### const
`The const declaration creates an immutable reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutable — just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.`
